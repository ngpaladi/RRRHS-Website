&nbsp;

When we created the Raritan River Chapter of the NRHS back in April 2011, we always had the intent to become a non-profit.  So in late 2011 we incorporated “The Raritan River Rail Road Historical Society Inc.” in the state of New Jersey as a 501(c)3 corporation.  We did this to keep things separate from our NRHS activities.  Since the focus of our non-profit was specifically directed to only preserving the history and artifacts of the Raritan River Railroad, it was a straight froward approach towards becoming a non-profit.

We are incorporated in the State of New Jersey as a 501(c)3 non profit corporation, we filed our IRS Form 1023, and received our exemption letter from the IRS on September 4th 2015 to finally finish and be a recognized non-profit.
